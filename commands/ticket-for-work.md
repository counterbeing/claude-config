# Make Ticket for Existing Work

1. Use the current git diff and our conversation to make a jira ticket using the MCP server. It should be one of the following projects: GLP, PART, DONOR, or CORE. Keep the ticket description short and concise. Write the body in the imperative, these are things to be done. Ask which project to use unless specified. The ticket should be assigned to me and be "In Development".
2. Stash the changes.
3. Make sure the latest is pulled.
4. Check out a new branch starting with the ticket number and have a short but descriptive name in kebab case. Eg. `GLP-1234-my-descriptive-ticket`.
5. Pop the changes from the stash.
6. Provide a link to the ticket in the output.
