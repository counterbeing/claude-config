# Summarize Issue

Use the current ticket number found on the branch name, look up the ticket in
jira using the MCP server, and summarize the issue in a file in the tmp folder
starting with the name of the ticket.

Look around at the code for anything that might be related and propose potential
solutions as part of the new summary document.
